# GameBarge

GameBarge is a basic collection of open-source web games developed by me! Each one has a use and purpose relating to the acquiration of in-game currency, known as Doubloons. As well, they each demonstrate a unique psychology trick used by video games and casinos to keep you playing just a liiiitle bit longer.

There are 4 games, 3 of which have started being developed so far. Each serve their own unique purpose, which will be detailed below.

IsleDig is the unlimited yield game - despite having slim odds of winning, you can put any amount of doubloons in, and therefore get 5x any amount back!

Wheel of Treasure is a pure chance game - simply spin the wheel and hope for the best.

Rusty slots is (still in development)

And last but not least, Smooth Sailing is a gradual difficulty increase skillbased dodging game, much like the Microsoft Surf Game.

**(LEADERBOARD COMING SOON)**

Have fun, and don't forget to take breaks!
